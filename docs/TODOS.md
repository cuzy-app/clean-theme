Google Fonts via API and download locally the font on configuration save.

If a horizontal menu is on multiple lines, 2 ideas:
- Display a dropdown menu at the right for the items after the first line
- Display all items on one line with the possibility to scroll horizontally(1)

(1) As the horizontal scrollbar should be hidden, the last item visible on the screen (at the one a right) should be cut by the edge of the screen to understand there are more items at the right. For desktop, it should be possible to scroll horizontally my holding the mouse click while moving it (as it is on touch screens).
